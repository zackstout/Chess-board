# Chess
Building a board for users to play chess. There are a few dreams: use Socket.io to recreate a version of [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/), create some crude AI to learn how to play by initially making random moves and reinforcing the moves it made if it wins.

The first central goal is to find the set of all valid moves, given a certain board state. We'll have to add the rules for each type of piece, and some user interface to "pick up" pieces, see where they're allowed to move, and click to move them there.

## Built with:
- p5.js
